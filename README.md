## 📖 Overview <a name="about-project"></a>

The LeaguesInfo WebApp is designed to give users a comprehensive look at their favorite leagues and teams. With our user-friendly interface, users can easily select their desired league and season to view a wealth of data on the teams, including stats such as goals and losses, as well as team names and logos. To ensure that we provide the most up-to-date and accurate information possible, we use the Football Standings API to fetch all of our data from the web. So whether you're a die-hard fan or just looking to stay informed, LeaguesInfo has everything you need to stay on top of the latest standings and stats for your favorite teams.

### Project Objectives <a name="project-requirements"></a>
